# HotelRestaurantFinder
The repository for storing the premade (by myself) Hotel and Restaurant Finder web-application. 
# Running the application
npm install
npm start
Then navigate to: localhost:3000. 
# Note
This project initially used a docker image and an AWS 
instance; however, this is too expensive to maintain
so now it is just an app that one can use locally.
